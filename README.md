# AdvisorAI

AdvisorAI is a 24/7 AI-powered academic advisor bot for students, accessible on Discord. It provides guidance when advisors are unavailable, helping students explore their academic paths independently. AdvisorAI is built using Ollama's LLM and integrates with a curated database from the Undergraduate Bulletin, focusing on the College of Engineering.

## Inspiration
Our experience with advisors frequently canceling on students inspired us to create a reliable AI-based solution for instant academic guidance.

## Features
- 24/7 access to academic advising on Discord
- Instant answers to questions about academic paths
- Focused on the College of Engineering with future plans for expansion
- Ability to provide relevant job data based on academic progress

## How It Works
1. **LLM Integration**: We used Ollama's language model and integrated it into a Discord bot.
2. **Data Source**: The bot references data from the College of Engineering’s Undergraduate Bulletin.
3. **Query Processing**: Users can type queries directly into Discord, and the bot uses the LLM to analyze and respond with personalized academic advice.

## Challenges
- Hardware limitations prevented us from using the entire Undergraduate Bulletin, so the bot currently references only the College of Engineering.
- Integrating and sequencing large amounts of document data into a functional, locally-hosted bot.

## Accomplishments
- Successfully configured the LLM to process document data from the Undergraduate Bulletin.
- Implemented a fully functional Discord bot that interacts with the LLM locally.

## What We Learned
- Building a minimum viable product (MVP) in a hackathon setting.
- Developing a deeper understanding of collaborative teamwork and problem-solving.
- Exploring the potential of AI in educational and advisory contexts.

## Future Plans
- Expand AdvisorAI to include the entire Undergraduate Bulletin and support graduate-level content.
- Integrate with Canvas to access personalized academic data, such as grades and classes.
- Provide relevant job data and career guidance based on students’ academic paths.
